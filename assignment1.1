1 What is a dictionary in Python?
Python dictionary is one of the supported data types in Python. 
It is an unordered collection of elements. 
The elements in dictionaries are stored as key-value pairs. 
Dictionaries are indexed by keys.

For example, below we have a dictionary named ‘dict’. 
It contains two keys, Country and Capital, along with their 
corresponding values, India and New Delhi.

Syntax:

dict={‘Country’:’India’,’Capital’:’New Delhi’, }

2.What are functions in Python?
A function is a block of code which is executed only when a call is made 
to the function. def keyword is used to define a particular function as 
shown below:

def function():
print("Hi, Welcome to Intellipaat")
function(); # call to the function
Output:
Hi, Welcome to Intellipaat

3.What are the common built-in data types in Python?
Python supports the below-mentioned built-in data types:

Immutable data types:

Number
String
Tuple
Mutable data types:

List
Dictionary
set

4.What are local variables and global variables in Python?
Local variable: 
Any variable declared inside a function is known as Local variable 
and it’s accessibility remains inside that function only.

Global Variable: 
Any variable declared outside the function is known as Global variable 
and it can be easily accessible by any function present throughout the program.

g=4                #global variable
def func_multiply():
l=5       #local variable
m=g*l
return m
func_multiply()
Output: 20
If you try to access the  local variable outside the multiply function 
then you will end up with getting an error.

5.Is indentation required in Python?
Indentation in Python is compulsory and is part of its syntax.

All programming languages have some way of defining the scope and 
extent of the block of codes. In Python, it is indentation. 
Indentation provides better readability to the code, 
which is probably why Python has made it compulsory.

6.How does break, continue, and pass work?
These statements help to change the phase of execution from the 
normal flow that is why they are termed loop control statements.

Python break: 
This statement helps terminate the loop or the statement and 
pass the control to the next statement.

Python continue: This statement helps force the execution of the next iteration 
when a specific condition meets, instead of terminating it.

Python pass: This statement helps write the code syntactically 
and wants to skip the execution. 
It is also considered a null operation as nothing happens 
when you execute the pass statement.

7.What is slicing in Python?
As the name suggests, ‘slicing’ is taking parts of.
Syntax for slicing is [start : stop : step]
start is the starting index from where to slice a list or tuple
stop is the ending index or where to sop.
step is the number of steps to jump.
Default value for start is 0, stop is number of items, step is 1.
Slicing can be done on strings, arrays, lists, and tuples.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(numbers[1 : : 2])  #output : [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

8.Mention five benefits of using Python
Here are the five benefits of using Python:

Python comprises of a huge standard library for most Internet platforms 
like Email, HTML, etc.
Python does not require explicit memory management as the interpreter itself 
allocates the memory to new variables and free them automatically
Provide easy readability due to use of square brackets
Easy-to-learn for beginners
Having the built-in data types saves programming time and 
effort from declaring variables

9.How Will You Check If All the Characters in a String Are Alphanumeric?
Python has an inbuilt method isalnum() which returns true 
if all characters in the string are alphanumeric. 

Example - 

>> "abcd123".isalnum()

Output: True

10.How Will You Merge Elements in a Sequence?
There are three types of sequences in Python:

Lists 
Tuples 
Strings
Example of Lists - 

>>l1=[1,2,3]

>>l2=[4,5,6]

>>l1+l2

Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

11.What Is the Difference Between Del and Remove() on Lists?
del

remove()

del removes all elements of a list within a given range 
Syntax: del list[start:end]
remove() removes the first occurrence of a particular character 
Syntax: list.remove(element)
Here is an example to understand the two statements - 

>>lis=[‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’]

>>del lis[1:3]

>>lis

Output: [“a”,”d”]

>>lis=[‘a’, ‘b’, ‘b’, ‘d’]

>>lis.remove(‘b’)

>>lis

Output: [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘d’]

12.How Do You Display the Contents of a Text File in Reverse Order?
You can display the contents of a text file in reverse order using the following steps:

Open the file using the open() function 
Store the contents of the file into a list 
Reverse the contents of the list
Run a for loop to iterate through the list

13.What Is Docstring in Python?
This is one of the most frequently asked Python interview questions

Docstrings are used in providing documentation to various Python modules, 
classes, functions, and methods. 

14. What is a boolean in Python?
Boolean is one of the built-in data types in Python, 
it mainly contains two values, and they are true and false. 

Python bool() is the method used to convert a value to a boolean value.

Syntax for bool() method: bool([a]) 

15.Define the term lambda?
Lambda is the small anonymous function in Python that is often used as an inline function.

16. When would you use triple quotes as a delimiter?
Triple quotes ‘’” or ‘“ are string delimiters that can span multiple lines 
in Python. 
Triple quotes are usually used when spanning multiple lines, 
or enclosing a string that has a mix of single and double quotes contained therein.

17. Write a program to count the number of capital letters in a file?
with open(SOME_LARGE_FILE) as countletter:
count = 0
text = countletter.read()
for character in text:
if character.isupper():
count += 1

18. What is the maximum length of an identifier?
Ans. The maximum possible length of an identifier in python is 79 characters.

19.Which statement can we use if the statement is required syntactically, 
but no action is needed for the program?
Ans. Pass statement is used if the statement is required syntactically, 
but no action is required for the program

20. How can you use ternary operators (Ternary) in Python?
Ans. Ternary operators are used to display conditional statements. 
This consists of the true or false values.  Syntax :

The ternary operator is indicated as:

[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false] x, y = 25, 50big = x if x <y else y

Example: The expression is evaluated as if x <and else and, 
in this case, if x <y is true, then the value is returned as big = x 
and if it is incorrect then big = y will be returned as a result.

21. What does this mean? * args, ** kwargs? Why would we use it?
Ans. * Args is used when you are not sure how many arguments to pass to a function, 
or if you want to pass a list or tuple of stored arguments to a function. 

** kwargs is used when we don’t know how many keyword arguments to 
pass to a function, or it is used to pass the values ​​from a dictionary 
as the keyword argument. 

The args and kwargs identifiers are a convention, you can also use * bob and 
** billy but that would not be wise>

22.What is the map function in Python?
Ans. The map function takes two arguments, one is iterable and another is 
a function and applies the function to each element of the iterable. 
If the given function accepts more than 1 argument then many iterables are given.

23.Explain the bytes() function in Python.
Ans. The bytes() function in Python returns a bytes object. 
It converts objects into bytes objects. It also creates empty bytes objects 
of the specified size.

24.Explain the ‘with statement’.
Ans. In Python, the ‘with statement’ is used for exception handling 
and resource management. It makes the code cleaner and readable as it allows 
a file to be opened and closed while executing a block of code containing 
the ‘with statement’.

25.Can we use a break and continue together in Python? How?
Break and continue can be used together in Python. 
The break will stop the current loop from execution, 
while the jump will take it to another loop.

26.In how many ways can we apply reverse strings?
There are five ways in which the reverse string can be applied:

Loops
Recursions
Stacks
Extended slice syntax
Reversed function

27. What is [::-1} used for?
[::-1} reverses the order of an array or a sequence. 
However, the original array or the list remains unchanged.

28. What are the is, not and in operators?
Operators are functions that take two or more values and return the corresponding result.

is: returns true when two operands are true
not: returns inverse of a boolean value
in: checks if some element is present in some sequence.
